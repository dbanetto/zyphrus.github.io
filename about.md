## History with Programming

I have been programming on and off since 2008 or around age 12.
Started off with an afternoon of trying to make a *"virus"* with Window's batch scripts.
From having to learn about how to script and the quirks with working with a large system like
Windows I was hooked. For those wondered the *"virus"* ended up just copying it self over and over again,
a disk space attack was all I was conformable with.

From there I was introduced to Visual Basic.NET and the .NET family thanks to my uncle.
Over time I progressed onto C*#* and made a simple application to manage some [game data](https://github.com/zyphrus/dire)
at the same time as learning git.
The inevitable of "I want to make a game" came around so I [picked up C/C++](https://github.com/zyphrus/asteroids).

A portion of this blog will be used to outline and describe some of my
research and findings as apart of my Honours project.
